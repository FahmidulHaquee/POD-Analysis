## Introduction

This project describes the application of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique to a fluid data representing a stirred-tank reactor system. The [POD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_orthogonal_decomposition) is an unsupervised machine learning technique which looks to extract the dominant pattern present in a physical field.
In the context of this project, where

The dataset is in this project represents the x and y-velocity of fluid at ~4,600 locations on a

It is related to the more widely known Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from the field of statistics, which looks to reduce a dataset with many dimensions to fewer, more important dimensions.
With PCA, each data point is projected with only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional whilst preserving as much of the data's variation, in terms of range, variance and standard deviation.

The POD technique is applied to a PIV dataset to extract dominant patters in the fluid motion
